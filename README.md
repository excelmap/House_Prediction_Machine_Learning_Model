The dataset contains 2,919 rows and 13 columns, with the following key observations:

Columns: It includes Id, MSSubClass, MSZoning, LotArea, LotConfig, BldgType, OverallCond, YearBuilt, YearRemodAdd, Exterior1st, BsmtFinSF2, TotalBsmtSF, and SalePrice.
Missing Values: Columns MSZoning, Exterior1st, BsmtFinSF2, TotalBsmtSF, and SalePrice have some missing values. Notably, SalePrice, likely the target variable, is missing for a significant portion of entries.

Here's an overview of the findings based on missing values and summary statistics:

Missing Values:

Minor missing values in MSZoning, Exterior1st, BsmtFinSF2, and TotalBsmtSF.
SalePrice is missing for nearly half of the entries, suggesting potential split data for training and testing.
Key Statistics:

LotArea ranges widely (from 1,300 to over 215,000), with high variability.
YearBuilt and YearRemodAdd indicate most houses were built or remodeled between 1950 and 2010.
